# Assignment-7
Program that implements bubble and merge sorting methods. Compares the time spent between each given a size of array to sort through.

Running this program will automatically start the sorting process with a predetermined array size of 100,000, starting with bubble sort first and immediately shifting to merge sort after. Results are printed to the console after sorting is completed. Please allow some time for the sort to finish.

*Additional, working functions for merge and bubble sort have been implemented, but will not be used in this program unless the code is explicitly altered.
